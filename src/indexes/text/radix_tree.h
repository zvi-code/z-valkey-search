/*

A radix tree, but with path compression. This data
structure is functionally similar to a BTree but more space and time efficient
when dealing with common prefixes of keys.

While the RadixTree operates on a word basis for the text search case the target
of the RadixTree is a Postings object which itself has multiple Keys and
Positions within it.

In addition to normal insert/delete operations, the RadixTree has a WordIterator
that supports iteration across multiple word entries that share a common prefix.
Iteration is always done in lexical order.

A Path iterator is provided that operates at the path level. It provides
iteration capabilities for interior sub-trees of the RadixTree. Functionally,
the Path iterator is provided a prefix which identifies the sub-tree to be
iterated over. The iteration is over the set of next valid characters present in
the subtree in lexical order. This iterator can be used to visit all words with
a common prefix while intelligently skipping subsets (subtrees) of words --
ideal for fuzzy matching.

Another feature of a RadixTree is the ability to provide a count of the entries
that have a common prefix in O(len(prefix)) time. This is useful in query
planning.

Even though the description of the RadixTree consistently refers to prefixes,
this implementation also supports a suffix RadixTree. A suffix RadixTree is
simply a RadixTree built by reversing the order of the characters in a string.
For suffix RadixTrees, the external interface for the strings is the same, i.e.,
it is the responsibility of the RadixTree object itself to perform any reverse
ordering that might be required, clients of this interface need not reverse
their strings.

Note that unlike most other search objects, this object is explicitly
multi-thread aware. The multi-thread usage of this object is designed to match
the time-sliced mutex, in other words, during write operations, only a small
subset of the methods are allowed. External iterators are not valid across a
write operation. Conversely, during the read cycle, all non-mutation operations
are allowed and don't require any locking.

Ideally, detection of mutation violations, stale iterators, etc. would be built
into the codebase efficiently enough to be deployed in production code.
