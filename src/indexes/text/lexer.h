The Lexer takes in a UTF-8 string and outputs a vector of words.
Each word output is decorated with metadata like it's physical location, etc.

1. The lexer treats configurable punctuation as whitespace.
2. The lexer supports escaping of punctuation to force its treatment as a
natural character that is part of a word.
3. Words are defined as sequences of utf-8 characters separated by whitespace.
