/*

For each entry in the inverted term index, there is an instance of
this structure which is used to contain the key/field/position information for each
word. It is expected that there will be a very large number of these objects
most of which will have only a small number of key/field/position entries. However,
there will be a small number of instances where the number of key/field/position
entries is quite large. Thus it's likely that the fully optimized version of
this object will have two or more encodings for its contents. This optimization
is hidden from external view. 

This object is NOT multi-thread safe, it's expected that the caller performs
locking for mutation operations.

Conceptually, this object holds an ordered list of Keys and for each Key there is
an ordered list of Positions. Each position is tagged with a bitmask of fields.

A KeyIterator is provided to iterate over the keys within this object.
A PositionIterator is provided to iterate over the positions of an individual Key.
